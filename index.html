     <p>Sokka is from the TV show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender">Avatar the Last Airbender</a> and he is the older brother of katara.
         Throughout the show Sokka is the seen as the older lead of the team. He is by far the funniest character
         and has the most impact on the show despite not having supernatural powers.
